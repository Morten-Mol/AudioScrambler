# Audio Scrambler

This project scrambles an audio file using a set of instructions, which can be seen as a encryption key.

The script can also de-encrypt the encrypted audio file by using the scrambling scrambling instructions in reverse.

## Project status

The project is currently under construction:
- The basic funtionalitiy of being able to scramble and de-scramble an audio signal without loosing information in between steps is still being worked on
- A simple GUI is also needed to guide the user in using the scrambling and de-scrambling functionality
